                <h2>
                <p>Viswanathan Anand (born 11 December 1969) is an Indian chess grandmaster and a former world chess champion. He became the first grandmaster from India in 1988, and is one of the few players to have surpassed an Elo rating of 2800, a feat he first achieved in 2006.

Anand is a five-time world chess champion. He defeated Alexei Shirov in a six-game match to win the 2000 FIDE World Chess Championship, a title he held until 2002. He became the undisputed world champion in 2007, and defended his title against Vladimir Kramnik in 2008, Veselin Topalov in 2010, and Boris Gelfand in 2012. In 2013, he lost the title to challenger Magnus Carlsen, and he lost a rematch to Carlsen in 2014 after winning the 2014 Candidates Tournament.

In April 2006, Anand became the fourth player in history to pass the 2800 Elo mark on the FIDE rating list, after Kramnik, Topalov, and Garry Kasparov. He occupied the number one position for 21 months, the sixth-longest period on record.

Known for h.is rapid playing speed as a child, Anand earned the sobriquet "Lightning Kid" during his early career in the 1980s. He has since developed into a universal player, and many consider him the greatest rapid chess player of his generation. He won the FIDE World Rapid Chess Championship in 2003 and 2017, the World Blitz Cup in 2000, and numerous other top-level rapid and blitz events.

Anand was the first recipient of the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award in 1991–92, India's highest sporting honour. In 2007, he was awarded India's second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, making him the first sportsperson to receive the award.</p>

                        <p    class="text-muted text-left">Bapuon is probably older than both Bayon Temple and the city of Angkor Thom as it was built in the 11th century by King Udayadityavarman 11 in his capital Yashodarapura , a town which has merged with Angkor Thom today. One of the must see monuments to see in Angkor Thom, it is referred to as the mountain temple for its sheer size. It was being restored when I visited it and hence we could not see most of it. The temple is shaped like a five tiered pyramid and although we were not able to enter some parts of it, we could see the bass reliefs which depict stories from the epics – Ramayana and Mahabharatha.</p>
